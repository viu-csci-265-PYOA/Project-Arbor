You wake in a moonlit cell.

Motes of dust float through the air, flickering in and out of existence
as they cross beneath the shadows of heavy iron bars.

Through a narrow window set high in the crumbling stone wall you can glimpse
a courtyard and within it stands a great oak tree.

Your choices are as vast as its sprawling branches. 

Where will your journey lead you?
