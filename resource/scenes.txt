The Dungeon:
You wake up in a moonlit cell. Motes of dust float through the air, 
flickering in and out of existence as the cross beneath the shadows 
of heavy iron bars. Through a narrow window set high in the
crumbling stone wall you can glimpse a courtyard and 
within it stands a great oak tree. 
Do you:
Option 1. Search your surroundings
Option 2. Try to open the cell door

You searched your surroundings
Your hands sift through the hay-strewn floor, but you find nothing 
that might help you escape the confines of the dungeon. In a matter 
of moments, two armoured guards appear to investigate the noise. 
Both guards pay you no attention.
Do you:
Option 1. Sit quietly and wait for them to leave
Option 2. Try to incapacitate one of them

You tried to open the cell door.
You grasp the thick iron bars and give a tug, but the lock holds 
fast. You won’t be getting out that way. Past the cell door an 
unlit torch is  propped against the wall. The bars are just wide 
enough for you to slip your arm through. The torch is just at the 
edge of your reach and your fingertips brush against its surface. 

You waited forever and it was a bad bad idea terrible idea wow 

Incapacitating them was even worse, good shit
