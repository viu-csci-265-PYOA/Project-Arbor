## Project intro

PYOA will be designing a single player, text-based game (code name Arbor), where the user is faced with different choices that guide the overarching story. Each action the user selects has the possibility of leading them down a specific branch of the game's narrative tree, allowing them to reach good, neutral or evil endings as well as customize the path that leads them there. Arbor is aimed at users who enjoy the fantasy genre and narrative driven content.  
   
Arbor is set in a realm beset by magical unrest, rivers run green, once fertile fields have become arid, and violent storms roll across the land. The user awakes in a dungeon with no memory of how they came to be there and only a mysterious amulet to guide their way. Will they be able to recover their memories and unravel the mystery, or will they too succumb to the dark magic seeping into the land?  
   
The objective of the game is to reach one of the three main narrative conclusions. The likelihood of reaching one of these endings is based upon the quality of the user’s decisions throughout the game. For instance, when faced with gathering information from one of the game’s NPCs, does the player attempt to befriend them or coerce them? If the player is more likely to choose the former, they proceed further down the branch leading towards the “Good” ending, whereas if they choose the latter, then that would lead down the “Evil” ending branch.

## Team philosophy

Team philosophies and priorities:

- Learning / teamwork / communication  
- Accountability \- making sure we stay on track with deliverables  
- Engagement \- actively precipitating course material and project deliverables  
- Commitment to actually trying to create something  
- Organization \- keeping code clean, documents readable, files easily findable, etc  
- Foster a supportive environment  
- Help one another in editing code and documents whenever possible   
- Being able to rely on each other

Team Goals:

- To put into practice lecture theory  
- To get the most out of what the course can teach us  
- To be supportive team members  
- And of course, get good marks

## Team roles/responsibilities

The initial of roles and responsibilities of team members has been divided in the following way:

- Project lead: duncan-mcleod-1996, *main contact*
  - Ma (understudy)  
- Lead programmer: milutopaz
  - duncan-mcleod-1996 (understudy)  
- Presentation lead: duncan-mcleod-1996/Ma
  - Timber-faol (understudy)  
- Testing lead: kayley-m
  - KristenM22 (understudy)  
- Narrative/creative: Ma
  - kayley-m (understudy)  
- Version control: Timber-faol
  - milutopaz (understudy)  
- Notetaking: KristenM22  
  - Ma (understudy)

   
Again, these roles are preliminary. Leads may change if the lead finds it is not working for them. Understudies will likely change as everyone wants to get the most out of what the course can give. In either case, changes shall be made as soon as possible during meetings, so the team can collectively provide support, change roles, or create/define a new role.

Workload shall be divided:

- Based on leads or  
- Collective discussion.

## Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

The team's chosen communication platform(s) that will be used throughout the term:

| | Communication Method |  Team Choice |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| 1. | Synchronous |   Discord virtual meeting, face-to-face meetings, MS Teams   |  
| 2. | Asynchronous |  Discord, E-mail  |

- If communication via Discord or other means is not possible, team members are permitted to use emails provided above as a last resort to update team members.  
    
- Handling situations where a team member is unable to attend a meeting:  
- We have agreed on a 3 strike policy for absence for scheduled meet ups:  
  - 1 forgiven  
  - 2 talk as team  
  - 3 contact instructor  
- See Conflict Resolution Scheme for more details.

Out-of-class, face-to-face meeting(s) are scheduled for:

- Monday, 11:30 \- 13:00  
- Thursday, 15:00 \- 16:30  
  - Their locations are ongoing and still actively looking for permanent locations. Generally, they have been in the bookable rooms of the library. 

Rules for preparing for, running, tracking decisions made, and following up on meetings,

- Unscheduled meeting times shall be agreed upon during meetings or through Discord.  
  - Each team member shall state times, dates, and location that works for them in the session-planning text channel.  
  - Or a member agrees with another member’s state time.  
- Each meeting’s minute shall be typed up and shared to the team’s shared Google Drive, so everyone can see what was discussed and decided.  
  - The minuter is generally voluntary or chosen at the beginning of the meeting.  
  - The minutes shall include decisions made in a readable, easy to find manner.  
- The scheduling for working collaboratively out-of-class shall be done through Discord, during team meetings, or other agreed upon communication platform(s).  
  - Each team member shall state times, dates, and location that works for them.  
  - Or a member agrees with another member’s state time.

## Deadlines and deliverables

Monday meetings are the primarily for planning the week like:

- deliverables,
- setting deadlines,  
- Assigning tasks,  
- For team members to update the team on an scheduling conflicts,  
- Make sure everyone is on track,  
- See if anyone needs support,  
- etc

All deliverables, either collaborative components or individual components, shall be ready to be finalized during Thursday meetings.

- The final version must be completed by 18:00 on the date of deadline even to ensure there is sufficient time for end-of-day submissions.

## Conflict resolution scheme

Conflict resolution regarding participation and meeting attendance:

- We have discussed the three strike rule regarding meeting attendance. Put simply, missing the scheduled meetings without any explanation or notice will result in a conversation with either the project lead or understudy. The goal of that conversation will be to determine a more effective way to ensure meetings can be attended regularly or properly communicated if attendance isn’t possible. Once an agreement has been reached, appropriate consequences will be determined (if necessary).  
- If meeting attendance or lack of communication persists for a second time, it will be brought during the next team meeting to determine appropriate measures.  
- If meeting attendance or lack of communication persists for a third time, then professor Wessels need to be involved in determining the next steps for offendant. Project lead will be the team’s liaison during this processes. It should be noted that the outcome could lead to team expulsion.

Conflict resolution regarding workload distribution:

- We have collectively agreed that given our lack of experience we will likely misjudge expected workloads of any given aspect of the project. With that in consideration, the roles and responsibilities will stay relatively fluid to avoid some team members getting stuck with significantly more work than others.  
- We have encouraged self advocacy when it comes to workload. If a member is feeling they are overwhelmed by the amount of work they are tasked with, it will be their responsibility to bring that to the group so we can discuss redistribution of work.

Conflict resolution regarding design and features:

- As a group, we have discussed design with a round table approach, giving every member the chance to share their opinions. When we do not have a clear direction and have differing opinions we will put it to a vote. In the event of a tie the team lead in charge of the given design or feature dispute will have final say in how to proceed.  

Conflict resolution regarding personal disputes:

- When it comes to personal disputes or clashes of personalities we will take the mediation approach. Any issues pertaining to this will be brought up to the project lead or understudy to help identify the root of the problem.
  - Once the problem has been identified, an appropriate conversation between members can be facilitated by the project lead or understudy.  
  - If no solution between those members can be established, the roles in the project can be modified to limit the interactions between those parties, leveraging understudies if necessary.  
- If there is an issue with the project lead, then the issue should be brought up during team meetings where the same conflict resolution scheme can be used to mediate the problem.  
- If no resolution can be found, then professor Wessels shall be brought in to help mediate the problem.

## Team AI policies

Team members are in agreement that the use of AI will be limited to being used as a tool to further understand concepts, but shall not under any circumstances be used for:

- Generating code  
- Generating deliverables or deliverable components  
- Plugging in team members intellectual property without approval

Examples of acceptable use cases:

- Brainstorming ideas  
- Learning syntax of a new coding language  
- Spell check: like Word’s/Google doc spell check  
- Grammer check: like Grammerly  
- Debugging code by using anonymous code snippets from the project code

## Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses
