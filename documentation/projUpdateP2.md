# CSCI 265 Project Update (Phase 2)

## Team name: Pick Your Own Adventure (PYOA)

## Project/product name: Arbor

## Contact person

 Duncan, Project Lead

## Key Updates

Our most significant additions are the completion of our standards and procedures documents and the set up of our team repository. In addition, Maddie (narrative lead) began narrative development for Arbor and Milu (programming lead) began research and prototyping the design of the project.

### Standards and Procedures Document

During this phase, we completed standards and procedures documents for:

- Documentation  
- Coding  
- Version Control

Our documentation standards outlined formatting requirements for our deliverables, and other documentation, including meeting minutes, and presentation notes. 

Our coding standards outline our general rationale as well as formatting and naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions.

Our version control standards outline general workflow for how we will be working on the project as well as the branching scheme for our repository and guidelines for commits and merging new content. 

### GitHub Repository

Team PYOA’s GitHub repository is called Project-Arbor under the organization viu-csci-265-PYOA. As version control lead and understudy, Timber and Milu, will be responsible for maintaining the repository. These positions may change throughout the course of the project. Each member responsible for maintaining the repository will be a member of the VERSION CONTROL team.

Each team member will contribute to development, using their locally cloned repository. Team members are encouraged to keep a daily workflow consistent with checking the Pull-Request discord channel and pulling new content to bring their repository up to dev’s current state before beginning work. Team members should commit often and submit pull requests when they believe their work is ready to be merged to development.

### Narrative Development

In phase 2, drafting and outlining began on one core branch of our narrative tree. Our starting scene "The Dungeon" is completely written, and features three junctions, allowing us to see how the branching could work for each of these game levels. In addition, this narrative branch contains five subsequent scenes that will become turning points once we begin incorporating other branches. 

### Design

In the process of creating a prototype for the system we will be using to navigate through gameplay. According to research, a composition style architecture over inheritance is better suited to our project. We have begun putting together mock-ups of headers and implementation files to capture what entities will be present in Arbor. Including:

- Actions  
- Game State  
- Rooms  
- Helper Functions
